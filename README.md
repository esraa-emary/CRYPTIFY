# CRYPTIFY

This is a GUI application (built with C#) that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a collection of classical cipher techniques.
The user-friendly interface makes it easy to choose a cipher, enter your message, and view the encrypted or decrypted output instantly.

## 📜 Supported Ciphers

1. **Atbash Cipher**  
   A monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to its reverse in the alphabet. For example, A becomes Z, B becomes Y, etc.

2. **Baconian Cipher**  
   A cipher that encodes each letter into a 5-letter string of A's and B's. It can be hidden in formatted text (like bold/italic) for steganographic purposes.

3. **Simple Substitution Cipher**  
   Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a unique corresponding letter from a scrambled alphabet. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
